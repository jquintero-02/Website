    <ul>
      <li> Python</li>
      <li> Natural Language Processing</li>
      <li> Machine Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I worked on several datasets to preform topic extraction. One was a dataset I built with a team at Outsmart Insight. This many focused on gathering topics from Academic Journal Abstracts to see trends in a certain field.
      Also, for a school project I used the Enron email corpus to get a glance at the main topics employes messaged about.  </p>
